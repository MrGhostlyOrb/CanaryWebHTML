						<h4>Marco and Adam selected for European championships</h4>
						<p>Marko Csokasi has been selected to do junior C1 500 and 1000 metres at the Junior / Under 23 Championships Adam Stannard has been selected to do Under 23 C2 500 metres with Iain Weir of Banbury. Marko is our first ever junior canoe in a major championships although we”ve had many kayaks. These two plus hopefully Nick R, Richard Hendron and Lizzie Boughton at the marathon worlds, (and maybe Marko again too) could make this our best year since the mid 90s. Trivia. Our first and so far only Olympic canoe paddler was Gerald Marchant who raced C1 at Helsinki before even I (Marcus) was born</p>
