						<h4>Membership benefits</h4>
						<p>
						Paddling at Canary Canoe Club is enjoyable, relaxing, fulfiling and hard 
						work – all at the same time.
						</p>
						<p>
						As a racing club that paddles throughout the year and in ALL 
						weathers we are looking to encourage people of all ages who are 
						keen to take up kayaking and canoeing – ideally to compete in 
						races at whatever level (and there are competitions for all abilities) – 
						and are looking to become involved in the activities and running of 
						the club.
						</p>
						<p>
						Below you will find details about equipment required, membership, 
						coaching and other FAQs. We have two starting groups – adults or 
						juniors.
						</p>
						<p>
						What you’ll need Firstly, you must be able to swim at least 100 metres fully clothed.
						</p>
						<p>
						It is important you wear the correct clothing when you come paddling. What you 
						wear should not saturate with water if you fall in. If you do not have gear designed 
						for water sports we recommend the following, depending on the conditions:
						</p>
						<p>
						Pair of old trainers or plimsolls (You may well be standing in the river – your feet will get wet)
						Tracksuit bottoms, leggings or shorts – Jeans or similar are not appropriate
						T-shirt, sweatshirt, thermal top
						Cagoule or a thin water proof and windproof top
						Towel
						You will get wet so you should have a change of clothes to put on after the session
						You should also advise your coach of any medical conditions.
						</p>
						<p>
						At busy times, particularly in the summer, we often have more people than we can 
						accommodate. Whilst we will do all we can to get everyone on the water, there are 
						no guarantees. Regrettably the decision as to who can paddle often has to be on the 
						tow path. We are a member’s club with no commercial remit and are looking to develop 
						paddlers in the long term, rather than support fair weather paddlers seeking summer 
						activities. Once you decide you like the club, you can apply for membership.
						</p>
						<p>
						Experienced racing paddlers moving to Canary Canoe Club from another club can bypass this process.
						</p>
						<h4>Membership</h4>
						<p>
						Novice paddlers who have successfully completed the relevant courses may then apply for 
						full club membership. New members must be signed off by their coach and all new applications 
						are subject to formal approval at Committee. Please talk to your coach or to the 
						membership secretary if you have any questions.
						</p>
						<p>
						About Canary Canoe Club
						We do not rent out canoes or kayaks. We are a club made up of members but are always looking 
						for new ones and so provide coach led groups for people who have never paddled before. We are 
						entirely non-commercial and “staffed” entirely by enthusiastic unpaid volunteers.
						</p>
						<p>
						We supply the kit, you supply the paddler. The club is able to provide a limited number of 
						boats, paddles and buoyancy aids so come along and try it out before you invest. Only in 
						very special circumstances is club kit allocated to a specific paddler, if you do want to 
						use the same kit week to week or feel you need better kit than what the club is supplying 
						go ahead and buy it. There are plenty of club members who can advise, or may have kit they 
						want to sell.
						</p>
						<p>
						Canary Canoe Club is a racing club, while not all of our members actively race – nor do 
						we insist on it – you will be encouraged to race at some level.
						</p>
						<p>
						While our members cover many disciplines the club’s primary focus is placid water canoe 
						sport – going from A to B as quickly as possible over distances ranging from 200 metres 
						to 125 miles. If you are already a competent paddle in this discipline or any other please 
						come on down and have a look what we are about. If you have not participated in paddle sport 
						before your introduction through us will be to the discipline of placid water racing.
						</p>
						<p>
						We paddle “tippy boats” Placid water racing kayaks and canoes are famous for their instability, 
						beginners will be introduced to the sport in boats that are far more stable than a racing 
						K1 but still far less stable than any other discipline’s boats, experience in another paddle 
						sport discipline will allow you to progress quicker but we will start you in the Beginner’s 
						or Reception group to assess your ability and find the right starter boat for you.
						</p>
						<h4>Coaching Structure</h4>
						<p>
						Moving beyond the Beginner’s Group, a coaching structure will progress you through different 
						levels to develop technique, fitness, waterman ship, strategy and other skills.
						</p>
						<p>
						Coach led groups take precedence over other activities when it comes to the use of club boats.
						</p>
						<h4>Safety is Paramount</h4>
						<p>
						Your safety and the safety of others is paramount. Membership of the club does not 
						entitle you to take out boats if and when you feel like it. Until the coach has cleared 
						you to paddle independently you may not be on the water in any boat that is stored at 
						the club unless you are with a club member who has been approved by the club coaches 
						to supervise other paddlers.
						</p>
						<p>
						When you are on the water under the supervision of another paddler, you are expected 
						to obey the instructions they give. They have the right to end any session.
						</p>
						<p>
						Membership does not entitle you to supervise other paddlers on the water, only a 
						club coach can decide that you have the ability to do this.
						</p>
						<p>
						Water conditions at Canary can vary because of the tidal nature of the Thames 
						at the club’s position on the river; your ability to paddle a boat in good conditions 
						does not translate into an ability to paddle in all conditions. In winter we have 
						conditions when even the most experienced paddlers choose not to go out on the water. 
						You are advised to check with others if you are uncertain.
						</p>
						<p>
						Any questions, please drop us an email.
						</p>
						<p>
						Happy Paddling.
