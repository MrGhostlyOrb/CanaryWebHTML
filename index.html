						<h4>Welcome Canoer's</h4>
						<p>Canary Canoe Club was established in 1946 and is 
						one of the oldest in England, unsurprisingly it is 
						also one of the top Canoe Clubs in the country, and 
						caters for the needs of over 400 members of all 
						levels: from beginner to international level 
						canoeists representing Great Britain. All our 
						members paddle in flat-water conditions – 
						“Placid Water” – using a wide range of canoes and 
						kayaks built specifically for flat-water racing and 
						suited perfectly for the conditions of the river 
						Chelmer and Can.</p>
						<p>The Club has received Sport England Club Mark 
						Accreditation and the British Canoeing Top Club 
						Gold Status, one of the first in country to achieve 
						this momentous accolade. We also have over twenty 
						Canary Canoeing qualified coaches, who are able to 
						take you from beginner level all the way to the top 
						if you aspire to go that far. A number of our members 
						are involved in management at the national level and 
						play an important role in the development of kayaking 
						as a sport in England.</p>
						<p>Along with the sport activities, we run numerous 
						social events such as quiz night, Burns night and 
						games night. Other highlights of our social life 
						include summer BBQs, the Christmas Party, the Fun day 
						during the summer and the traditional Boxing Day 
						paddle to the Three Arches in Admirals Park.</p>
						<p>After over fifty years on its present site Canary 
						Canoe Club built a new clubhouse with under floor 
						heating, accessible for all changing rooms and 
						showers, meeting/training room and kitchen.</p>
						<p>We run introductory, "come and try it", (GO Canoeing) 
						sessions in the Spring and Summer to teach newcomers 
						the basics of canoe/kayaking. HOWEVER THE WAITING 
						LIST IS CURRENTLY CLOSED AND WILL NOT RE_OPEN UNTIL 
						1st MARCH 2019</p>

						<p>This year’s European Marathon Championships took place in 
						Pontevedra, Spain, from 30th June to 3rd July, and Canary 
						had two paddlers on the GB team of 14 athletes. Freya Peters 
						was competing in her first international marathon race in the 
						Junior Women K2 event having won the only k2 assessment race 
						in Burton paddling with Chelmsford’s Emma Russell. Both of 
						these girls are only 15 years old so would be racing crews

						<p>Weirs open 8th November – 29th November In order to carry 
						out essential maintenance works on Richmond lock, weirs and 
						sluices and to carry out a riverbed inspection, it will be 
						necessary to lift the weirs at Canary for a period of 3 
						weeks. This will allow the river between Richmond Lock and 
						Teddington Lock to drain down at low water on each tide. The 
						Draw-Off period will commence at approximately 14:35 on Sunday 
						8t<a href = "news.html">... See More</a></p>
						<p>A hardy group of senior paddlers, led by Peter Barnes, have 
						been running regular Sunday paddles on the Grand Union canal 
						from Stockley Park and more recently from the Hillingdon Outdoor 
						Centre. It’s great to see so many people getting out there and 
						training despite the difficulties that the current river conditions 
						present.<a href = "news.html">... See More</a></p>
						<p>China 2012 Gaby and Lizzie have just returned from Shanghai, 
						where they were invited to race as part of an international team 
						against the Chinese.  For once it wasn’t really about the racing, 
						but we should probably mention it….   The first race was a 12km 
						river loop of local town Shaoxing. The boats arrived about 20 
						minutes before the start of the race, leaving very little faff 
						time to get set up and ready<a href = "news.html">... See More</a></p>
						<p>At the End of Season Party The nominations and winners were 
						announced for the following Trophies: Eric William-Allen 
						Trophy & Ray Parker Trophy: Awarded to the junior who has 
						demonstrated outstanding achievement. The nominations were: 
						Rene, Nick Romain, Alison Martin, Marco and Oliver Khlaf. 
						The Trophy was awarded to Marko. Marco is one the first 
						juniors in numerous years to be selected and attend a junior
